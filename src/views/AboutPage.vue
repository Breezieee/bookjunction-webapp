      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Book Junction was founded by a group of students who saw the need for a more affordable
        way to access educational resources. Frustrated by the high cost of textbooks, we decided
        to create a platform where students could easily buy and sell their books. Since our launch,
        we’ve helped countless students save money and succeed in their studies.
